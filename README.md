Simon Game

This repository contains the source code for a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, designed to test and improve short-term memory skills. The game presents players with a sequence of lights and tones, which they must repeat in the correct order to progress to the next level.

Game Description
The Simon Game was originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison and programmed by Lenny Cope for the toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates. It became a popular electronic game due to its simple yet challenging gameplay that tests a player's memory.

In this web version of Simon:

A sequence of colored buttons will light up and play tones.

Players must memorize and repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.

The sequence grows progressively longer with each successful round, increasing the challenge.


Features:
Interactive and responsive game interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Engaging sound and visual effects to replicate the classic Simon experience.
Levels get progressively harder with each round.


How to Play:
Press the Start button to begin the game.

Watch as the Simon Game displays a sequence of lights and sounds.

The game ends if you click the buttons in the wrong order.
